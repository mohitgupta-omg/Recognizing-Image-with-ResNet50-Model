# Recognizing-Image-with-ResNet50-Model
Working on Keras and using ResNet50 model for Image Recognition


**Keras** provides the users with its built-in image recognition modules. 
These modules are trained from **ImgeNet** data to recognize images. The ImagNet data set is a collection of millions of pictures of objects that have been labelled, so that you can use them to train your system.

I have used the ResNet50 model to build my image recognition system. **ResNet50 model was developed by Microsoft** and is one of the best models available to recognize images.
